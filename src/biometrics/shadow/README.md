# Prospective shadow storage

`ShadowStore` is the storage component for prospective monitoring. It uses only
`biometric_shadow_runs` and `biometric_shadow_samples`, added by a generated
additive biometrics migration. It does not write canonical vitals, activate a
profile, import algorithm code, or control hardware. It is not yet wired to a
live worker or public API.

A frozen plan binds side, active/candidate configuration hashes, reviewed
qualification and engine-build identities, a prospective time window (at most
seven days), selected metric definitions, and explicit point/byte limits.
Identities alone do not establish qualification: the eventual controller must
resolve the release-installed build and qualification before admission.
No CPU, RSS, free-space reserve, or production storage defaults are inferred.

Create is idempotent for an exact plan. New plans cannot start in the past.
Claim invokes a trusted synchronous admission check inside the write transaction
and grants an expiring attempt lease. At most one live worker per side is allowed.
A replaced/expired worker cannot append, renew, or finish over its successor.
Retained samples survive replacement and carry the original attempt identity.
The controller must reset processing state at the new attempt boundary.

Append validates side, exact active/candidate configuration, input identity,
selected metrics, ordered sequence/time, and the prospective window. Candidate
and contemporaneous active readings are retained separately in each sample;
missing values remain null, never zero. Metrics use canonical units: heart rate
in bpm, breathing rate in breaths/min, and `window_ibi_variability_v1` in ms.
The variability index must not be interpreted as RMSSD or SDNN. Exact retries do
not consume quota; conflicting retries fail.

Per-run and global point/byte limits are checked in the same immediate SQLite
transaction as insertion. Exhaustion atomically stops that run with
`storage_quota`, preserving prior evidence. A run-count quota also bounds plan
metadata. Byte counts measure serialized sample payloads, not SQLite page/WAL
allocation; filesystem reserve and database maintenance remain host obligations.
There is no automatic deletion of reports, plans, or exposure history.

`stop` supports host/operator cancellation even after deadline or worker loss,
retaining the original terminal reason on retries. The controller must stop
elapsed windows and enforce execution budgets separately. Heartbeat and sample
identity support later health/coverage and reference-comparison reporting; those
services and the live shadow processor are still to be connected.
